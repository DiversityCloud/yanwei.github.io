I graduated with a Ph.D. from the College of Intelligence and Computing at Tianjin University, China, in June 2024. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research topic focuses on online social networks, recommendation systems, and machine learning.

 I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of [Prof.Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/papers.html) at [PKU-DAIR Lab](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR)
